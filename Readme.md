Reverse tunneling in Windows. 

Try it out: http://eirikb.github.io/Netro/1.0.1/Netro.exe  
Warning: Executable, use at your own risk!  
Netro works perfectly with mono for Linux / OSX.

I usually fire up `ssh -R` when I need some reverse tunneling, on any platform.
But sometimes I have to tunnel from Windows to Windows, and this is a bit more difficult, as I usually don't have sshd running on Windows servers.  
Netro, a bad play on "Metro" is here to help me and others that must do some quick, dirty and simple tunneling on Windows.


Here is an example:
The right side in the following figure is behind a firewall, the left side is publicly accessible.

1.  Netro A listens for incoming connections, and listens for reverse tunneling.
2.  Netro B connects to A for tunneling.
3.  When a client connects to A the data will be transferred through the link between A and B.
4.  Connection is made on B to desired host:port.
5.  Data can now flow both ways.
